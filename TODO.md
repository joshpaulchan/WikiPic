# TODO

+ So we have something running on one of the servers (probably on urwebsrv) that rcvs the images that we send
+ We can email or use dropbox API or upload directly
+ It should also display a list of the current images in the library
+ When you upload it should give you a link or the name of the file (easily copied) to paste into the pmwiki page
